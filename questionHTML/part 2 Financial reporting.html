    In May 2018 Wellcome simplified its standard revenue and equity share for projects governed by our&nbsp;standard
    Grant Conditions&nbsp;<span class="menuHelper helpText">(see menu&nbsp;<img

    adopting
    a flat rate 25% Wellcome share, with no technology transfer fee. Universities, research institutes and others
    holding grants under Wellcome’s standard Grant Conditions may use this new simpler approach&nbsp;<span

    may have
    entered into a revenue
    share agreement with Wellcome prior to 1 May 2018 providing for a higher Wellcome share.&nbsp;<br />

    Any award holder having entered into bespoke funding arrangements with Wellcome’s Innovations Team (i.e. not under
    our Standard Grant Conditions) and using this template to report their IP activities, should calculate revenue and
    equity as provided for by those bespoke arrangements, unless informed otherwise.<br>

    <br />
    Your Organisation may apply each year to retain some or all of the revenue share due to Wellcome over the prior
    12-months. Requests to retain funds can only be made in order to fund new translational activities which support
    Wellcome's mission to improve human health, or to support equitable access to healthcare interventions. Wellcome
    will review the request and inform you of our decision. If Wellcome rejects your application (in whole or in part)
    we will issue an invoice for payment of our revenue share (or the relevant portion of it which remains due after any
    permitted revenue retention is deducted).
